# AWS Comprehensive Threat Modeling Template

A comprehensive threat modeling template for the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT) covering all AWS services and their specific security considerations during my stint at onclusive india. 

## Overview

This template provides a complete set of stencils, threats, and mitigations for AWS cloud infrastructure security modeling and azure components. It enables security teams, architects, and developers to create detailed threat models for AWS-based applications and infrastructure.

## Features

- **Comprehensive AWS Service Coverage**: Includes stencils for all AWS services across compute, storage, database, networking, security, and other categories
- **AWS-Specific Threats**: Custom threats based on the STRIDE model but tailored to AWS environments
- **Detailed Mitigations**: Practical security controls and best practices specific to AWS
- **AWS Trust Boundaries**: Predefined trust boundaries for AWS environments
- **Regularly Updated**: Maintained to include new AWS services and emerging threats

## How to Use

1. Download and install the [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool](https://aka.ms/threatmodelingtool)
2. Download the `AWS-ThreatModeling-Template.tb7` file from this repository
3. Open the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool
4. Select "Template for New Models" and browse to the downloaded .tb7 file
5. Create a new model using this template
6. Begin modeling your AWS infrastructure

## Template Structure

The template is organized into the following sections:

### AWS Service Stencils

Stencils are grouped by AWS service categories:
- Compute Services (EC2, Lambda, ECS, etc.)
- Storage Services (S3, EBS, EFS, etc.)
- Database Services (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
- Networking & Content Delivery (VPC, CloudFront, etc.)
- Security, Identity & Compliance (IAM, Cognito, etc.)
- And many more categories covering all AWS services

### AWS-Specific Threats

Threats are categorized according to the STRIDE model but customized for AWS:
- Spoofing (credential theft, account hijacking, etc.)
- Tampering (unauthorized modifications to resources)
- Repudiation (logging disabled or tampered)
- Information Disclosure (data leakage, misconfigured access)
- Denial of Service (resource exhaustion, API limits)
- Elevation of Privilege (IAM escalation paths, role chaining)

### AWS-Specific Mitigations

Detailed mitigations for AWS environments:
- IAM and Identity Security best practices
- Network Security controls
- Data Protection mechanisms
- Monitoring and Detection strategies
- Compute Security hardening

## Contributing

Contributions to improve this template are welcome! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-aws-service`)
3. Add or update the template
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add support for new AWS service'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-aws-service`)
6. Open a Pull Request

## Keeping Up-to-Date with AWS Services

AWS regularly introduces new services and features. This template aims to stay current with these changes. If you notice a missing service or threat, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Example Threat Models

The repository includes example threat models for common AWS architectures:
- Three-tier web application
- Serverless application
- Containerized microservices
- Data lake architecture
